## Humble

Humble lets you write client-side web applications in pure go. You can compile humble
apps to javascript with gopherjs to run them in the browser. Humble is a framework made
up of several loosely connected packages. You can use all of the packages together or
pick and choose only the packages you want.

## Where'd Everything Go?

If you're looking for the files that used to be in this repository, they have all been
moved to stand-alone packages. Check out the
[Humble Organization](https://github.com/go-humble) to view all the packages!

## What is this Repository?

This repository is nothing right now. In the near future it will be a command-line tool
for generating new humble projects. It will be the thing that ties all the individual
packages together into a framework.
